Key exchange protocol

This module implements DH key exchange using GMP and a small RSA implementation.

Notes:

Calling processes should implement memory locking, perhaps using:
  mlockall(MCL_CURRENT|MCL_FUTURE);
Not doing so could result in keys leaking to swap.

In the future, this library may implement custom allocation for GMP:

TODO:
-pass a function pointer for fill_random to emsa_pss_encode
-hopefully, run a buildbot to test new revisions
-add a fuzzer that throws random data at emsa_pss_* code
 (to find any buffer overflows or other errors)
