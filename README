Key exchange protocol

This module implements DH key exchange using GMP and a small RSA implementation.

Notes:

Calling processes should implement memory locking, perhaps using:
  mlockall(MCL_CURRENT|MCL_FUTURE);
Not doing so could result in keys leaking to swap.

In the future, this library may implement custom allocation for GMP:
